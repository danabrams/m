## Core Aesthetic: Calm, Dense, Terminal-Honest

### Calm
- Reserve color for what needs attention
- No animations that demand focus
- Notifications escalate gently, then stop
- Never auto-decide for the user

### Dense
- Information over decoration
- Tight spacing, no hero images
- Monospace where appropriate
- Every pixel earns its place

### Terminal-Honest
- Show what's actually happening
- Elapsed time, not fake progress bars
- Real error messages, not "Oops!"
- Monospace for agent output

## Terminal Aesthetic, iPhone-Native UX

**Look like a terminal:**
- Dark backgrounds acceptable
- Monospace text for output
- Minimal chrome
- Dense information display

**Feel like an iPhone app:**
- Standard iOS navigation (push/pop, sheets)
- Native gestures (swipe back, pull to refresh)
- System fonts for UI elements
- Respect Safe Areas and Dynamic Type
- Thumb-zone aware (actions at bottom)
- Standard iOS patterns (action sheets, alerts)

The visual language is terminal-inspired.
The interaction language is pure iOS.

## What M is NOT

- Not playful (no emoji, no cute mascots)
- Not enterprise (no dashboards, no charts)
- Not anxious (no red alerts for normal states)
- Not a web app in disguise (no hamburger menus, no custom gestures)

## The Feel

A professional tool for someone who trusts their AI agent
but wants to keep one hand on the wheel.

Like SSH on your phone — but friendly.
